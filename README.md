Modules and code to run the invertion problem of a bio-optical model. 
As part of the National Institute of Oceanography, and Applied Geophysics, I'm working on an invertion problem. A detaile description can be found in the documentation.pdf file. 

cst.csv and cte_lambda.csv are the constants necessary for the program to work, but it also requare imput data, which is not on the repository (probably on a future I will post the data somewere else, depending if the data is free to share or not). PySurfaceData contains all the models used for the invertion problem.
